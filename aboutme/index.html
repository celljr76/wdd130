    <h2>Phil</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone, I am Phillip Illguth. I currently live in Fruit Heights Utah with my wife and dog(Islay). I am currently working on getting my Associates in Applied Technology. With 2 certificates, being
        one in computer programming and database. I have a job with the Salt Lake County Sheriff's office working as a civilian. I am not looking to change careers, but simply increasing my knowledge about something I enjoy, which is computers.
        I am taking this course to fulfill the credits for one of my certificates. I'm hoping to get to learn how to make a proper website. I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
        all my life. My favorite scripture is Alma 7: 11-13. The most thing I love about BYU-Idaho is being able to attend while at home and working at the same time. I also enojoy playing video games
        and spending time with my family.
    </p>
